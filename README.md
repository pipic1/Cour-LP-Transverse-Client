# Cour-LP-React-PWA

Going to create a React App
Build a PWA installable APP
With a little design framework 

##1️⃣ Clone react-app repo

Via npm, we gonna clone the Create-React-App template purposed by Facebook. 

### npx

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

### or via npm

```sh
npm init react-app my-app
```

## 2️⃣ Common commands

Now we have the app ! Cool, 
What you can do for now: 

Success! Created my-app at C:\Users\{your_username}\Developpement\Cour-LP-Transverse-Client\my-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

```sh
  npm start
``` 
Starts the development server.
    
   
```sh
  npm run build
```
Bundles the app into static files for production.

```sh
  npm test
```
Starts the test runner.

```sh
  npm run eject
```
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```sh
  cd my-app
  npm start
```
